Small blogging platform in php.

I am creating this to assist me in learning PHP. If I like it enough when I am finished I will use it myself.

TODO:
Fix code so it can actually return the sample post from the MySQL db
Add a system to have a new page for every 5 posts
Develop a GUI to add posts rather than manual entry into the DB
