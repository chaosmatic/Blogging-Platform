<h2>Minecraft</h2>
My minecraft server is running on a Raspberry Pi. With such computing restraints, gameplay is somewhat restricted and only 2 people will be able to play at the same time.
<p>
The address is minecraft.milfordsworld.com
<p>
I have uploaded each of the maps, or screenshots of portions of them for historical reference.<p>
The server was first known as 1337craft.dydns.org, before I bought a domain.<p>
<a href="world.png">First Map</a>- First played around the 23rd of February 2011, in Beta 1.3. Was not used after the introduction of the second map.<br>
<p>The server changed name in May 2011 to jcpla.net:1337 as I bought a domain name.<p>
<a href="world2.png">Second Map</a>- First played around the 16th of June 2011 in Beta 1.6.6. Was not used after the introduction of the third map.<br>
<p><a href="world3.png">Third Map</a>- First played around the 13th of July 2011 in Beta 1.7.3. 
<p> The server changed names again in November 2011 to milfordsworld.com - the name it retains to this day.
<p><b>The end of the server</b> <br>After excessive griefing which took the server down for two weeks, the server started to decline. The third map was briefly replaced by a hunger games map and plugin on the 10th of August 2012. The server was taken down on the 24th of August 2012, just over one and a half years after the server began.

<h3>The hardware of the server</h3>
The server has run on 4 machines over its lifetime. It first ran on my personal tower (Core 2 Quad @ 2.66Ghz, 4 Gb RAM), however I desired a dedicated machine.
<p>
I  aquired another, small form factor tower (Pentium 4 @ 3.00Ghz, 512Mb RAM) for $10 however did not set the memory allocation right - forcing it to use swap. 
<p>
I then decided to upgrade to a retired 1U (skinny) rack server (Dual Xeons @ 3.00Ghz, 4 Gb ECC RAM) which cost $130. However this had two major issues: power and noise. Firstly it consumed a lot of power - a minimum of $40 a month, which is far more expensive than any Minecraft Server on the market. Secondly the 5 fans run at a minimum of 7000 RPM due to the small size, which makes quite a racket.
<p>
 I finally bought a T61 Lenovo laptop (Dual core @ 2.1Ghz @ 2Gb RAM) for $100. This solved my issues, but slowly died due to running 24/7. I repaired it and refurbished it for personal use after the end of the server.<p>
<!--<strike>Due to excessive griefing from shady characters such as Zennon Doulis (minecraft accounts:weirdz101, awesome123456121 and Luna_Frost), Angus Roberts (minecraft account:angrock709), Jasper McMahon (minecraft account:JaZa1o1), Connor Webster (minecraft accounts:connorsw2 and superkiller967), my server is now a whitelist server, so if you want to play you will have to <a href="/contact/index.php">email me your username.</a></strike>
