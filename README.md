# Blogging-Platform

This is a small lightweight blogging engine written in PHP and using a MySQL database. At the moment this repo also contains my personal website files as well. At some point I should seperate it out and make sure that the Blogging Platform stands on its own.

## Installation

- You need a working MySQL install
- You need php enabled (obviously)
- Download and unzip this repo in your webservers root folder
- Ensure that config.php is writeable by the webserver user and not visible to public.
- navigate to the index.php and it will run you through the rest.
