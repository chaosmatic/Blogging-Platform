<p>The book is contructed of chapters containing Evidence, Hypothesis and other chapters including details the events that occurred in throughout John Wade's life, focusing on those that occurred in The lake of the Woods.</p>

<p>The books progressively reveals John's Electoral loss and how it was caused by the revelation of atrocities committed in Vietnam. It slowly goes through the circumstances in which his wife disappear. The Hypothesis' become more and more sinister and accuse John of doing worse actions, culminating in the hypothesis that he boiled his wife. However, towards the end of the novel there is a mood change which is much more hopeful. Throughout the Evidence chapter and throughout the book the deep psychological issues in John and revealed and accounted for. </p>

<p>There is large amounts of repetition where an entire paragraph is repeated verbatim later in the novel.</p>

<p>There is large amounts of repetition where an entire paragraph is repeated verbatim later in the novel. There are also several motifs, with the most pronounced one being two snakes eating each other, with John reflecting that 1 + 1 = 0. </p>

<p>The book presents John Wade as having taken part in the My Lai massacre, and in the evidence section uses actual facts about the actual My Lai massacre and aftermath.</p>

<p>The book often questions the knowability of truth. The unnamed narrator states in the footnotes: “evidence is not truth”. The novel does not present a solid answer to the problem of the disappearance of John Wade's wife or John Wade himself, but only presents certain possibilities. It is quite postmodern.</p>

<p><b>Overview of each Chapter:</b></p>

<p>Chapter 1: Introduces John and Kathy, sitting in the cottage and their great grief. It introduces their manner of dealing with bad things, which is escaping by imagining. It gives a clue of John's instability and rage.</p>

<p>Chapter 2: This is the first evidence chapter and gives a tantalising foretaste of things to come, hinting that Kathy will disappear. </p>

<p>Chapter 3: This chapter reveals that John lost his father when he was a young boy, and to deal with it he had imaginary conversations with him. This gives us an idea of John's way of dealing with his emotions, by pretending that his issues don't exist.</p>

<p>Chapter 4: Reveals the events of the day before Kathy disappears and that John will be able to remember some things and won't be able to remember others. </p>

<p>Chapter 5: this is the First Hypothesis chapter. The hypothesis is that Kathy had a secret lover who picked her up while John was sleeping and then they drove off and vanished.</p>

<p>Chapter 6: Another evidence chapter, explores war, magic and why Kathy may have wanted to run away with a lover.</p>

<p>Chapter 7: This chapter reveals a large amount about Johns childhood, including his obseesion with magic. It also recounts him killing a Viet Cong sniper and getting the name sorcerer. It also details how he would spy on Kathy.</p>

<p>Chapter 8: This details how the night passed, with John boiling some plants. He goes for a swim. He returns to bed and Kathy isn't there, although he doesn't realise. It is deliberately vague about certain things, relying on Johns poor memory to protect the mystery.</p>

<p>Chapter 9: Another hypothesis chapter. The hypothesis is that Kathy awoke and saw John boiling plants. She was scared but stayed and watched as John poured boiling water into the bed where she had been. She then ran towards the Rasmussen house, but took a wrong turn, sprained her ankle or got lost. </p>

<p>Chapter 10: This chapter reveals more about John's disturbed childhood and his obsession with magic, his spying on Kathy, his time in Vietnam and his killing of PFC Weatherby.</p>

<p>Chapter 11: This chapter discusses what John did in the next day. John decided that she wouldn't be too long and did some cleaning, sorted out some bills and went to look for her. He then looked for the boat and discovered it was gone. He then reported that she was gone to the Rasmussens.</p>

<p>Chapter 12: Another evidence chapter with a focus on magic, Vietnam veterans, Nuremberg and politics. </p>

<p>Chapter 13: What happened at My Lai is directly revealed and the passage about John killing PFC Weatherby is repeated verbatim. </p>

<p>Chapter 14: A hypothesis that Kathy went on a boating trip had an accident and drowned.</p>

<p>Chapter 15: John is interviewed by Lux and Vinny, the county sheriffs. Pat organises to come over. Vinny strongly believes that John killed Kathy. </p>

<p>Chapter 16: An evidence chapter with a focus on My Lai and the Court Martials hat took place. It mentions the Geneva convention and partial list of Johns tricks.</p>

<p>Chapter 17: John's long hard rise to power in politics. It also recounts Tony asking him is he had any dirt and John denied it.</p>

<p>Chapter 18: A hypothesis chapter which proposes that she got lost in the lake and landed with her boat at an island. </p>

<p>Chapter 19: The search for Kathy has been going for two whole days and nothing was found. John talks to Pat about Kathy and Pat doesn't think John knew her well.</p>

<p>Chapter 20: evidence about how secret and furtive John was and about the atrocities in Vietnam is presented.</p>

<p>Chapter 21: John's childhood is discussed, along with Vietnam and the loss of the election. Charlie company was told to search My Lai for weapons but could not find any. John's father's alcoholism is discussed and the fact that his father constantly teased him. The direct aftermath of the election is also discussed and how the Rasmussens offered them a place in the lake of the woods. </p>

<p>Chapter 22: A continuation of the last hypothesis, detailing how Kathy may have left the island she landed on. It also reveals a night she spent with Tony Carbo, John's campaign manager, in a casino.</p>

<p>Chapter 23: John's part in the search is detailed. The search for Kathy is ended and the search for the body begins.</p>

<p>Chapter 24: A hypothesis about Kathy's affair with Harmon and highlights the possibility of suicide.</p>

<p>Chapter 25: An evidence chapter again focussing on Vietnam, but also atrocities committed by the British army when they settled America. John's extra names are discussed and there is a footnote from the nameless narrator about mystery. </p>

<p>Chapter 26: John got a desk job in the army after his tour finished so that he could remove himself from Charlie company and transplant himself and all his history into Alpha company so that nobody may realise he took part in the massacre. </p>

<p>Chapter 27: A hypotheses that John boiled Kathy and then sunk her in the boat deep in the Lake. </p>

<p>Chapter 28: John leaves in a borrowed boat and he doesn't return. He ridicules human choice, saying he fell into everything, like you fall asleep. He desires to feel like Kathy felt. Although he isn't sure, he believes she left in the boat and got lost. </p>

<p>Chapter 29: A geographical area known as “the Angle” is discussed and it is mentioned that Kathy is underwater. </p>

<p>Chapter 30: The last evidence chapter, mainly featuring quotes from the other characters hypothesising about what they could've done, perhaps running away to Canada. Thinbill mentions how he dobbed John in but had already pleaded him to come clean with him and tell the authorities. </p>

<p>Chapter 31: this chapter concludes that there is a possibility that they ran away to Canada but affirms the mystery.</p>
