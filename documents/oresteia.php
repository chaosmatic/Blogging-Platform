<h2>The Oresteia</h2>
<p>By: Aeschylus, translated by Fagles<br>
Published: Written and performed ~458BC translated and published 1975<br>
Set: In Argos, at the conclusion of the ten years of war at Troy.</p>

<b>Agamemnon</b>

<p>In the house of Atreus, the watchmen receives a signal that troy has fallen. Cytaemenestra rejoices, and tells the old men of Argos.</p>

<p>A herald arrives with the message of the victory and adds that all of the shrines in troy were destroyed (that is to say the city was decimated, pillaged or raped). Agamemnon arrives and Clytaemnestra proclaims her love for him. She convinces him to walk on red tapestries into the house, like a god. While he initially reacts to this and refuses, she quite quickly subdues him and he commits this act of hubris, or extreme pride. This is wrong and punishable by the gods.</p>

<p>Clytaemnestra and Agamemnon walk to their house. Cassandra, a priestess of apollo and mistress of Agamemnon stays behind, and prophesies that Clytaemnestra will kill her and Agamemnon. She enters the house and is killed by Clytaemnestra. Clytaemnestra kills Agamemnon for sacrificing their daughter Iphegeneia and kills Cassandra for being his mistress. Clytaemnestra and Aegisthus come out of the house and gloat over the bodies of Agamemnon and Cassandra</p>

<p><b>The Libation Bearers</b></p>

<p>Orestes is at his fathers grave, mourning, when some women approach. He hides as he has been exiled from the country. He realises that one of the women is Electra, his sister. She prays for someone to avenge her father. This motivates Orestes to kill his mother. Electra discovers his presence and they plan the murder. Orestes receives news of his mothers dream. In the dream she gives birth to a snake, and raises it. Orestes interprets this to mean that he is the serpent and he is to grow up to kill his mother. This is similar to the lion cub metaphor which runs throughout the paly 'Agamemnon'.</p>

<p>Orestes and his assistant travel to the house of Atreus. They pretend to be strangers, bringing news of Orestes death. His childhood maid is quite upset. He kills Aegisthus, but is torn between killing his mother and letting her live. If he kills her, he commits a matricide and incurs the wrath of the furies (avenging spirits). However, if he lets her live he will be tormented by his conscience for letting his father's death go unavenged. Before he kills her there is a verbal exchange between them and she realises that he is the snake that she dreamed about. He kills her and then displays Clytaemnesta and Agisthus's bodies, in the same way Clytaemnestra dislpayed Agamemnon and Cassandra.</p>

<p>Orestes feels some guilt. He is then pursued by furies to Apollo's shrine in Delphi. He does this as Apollo is the god who urged him on. </p>

<p><b>The Eumenides</b></p>

<p>The priest at the shrine of Apollo sees a vision of Orestes and Apollo. Apollo puts the furies to sleep and cleanses Orestes. He then calls Hermes to escort Orestes to Athens. The ghost of Clytaemnestra appears and wakes the furies. Apollo argues with the furies and they leave.</p>

<p>In Athens, Orestes is still pursued by the furies. However, he calls upon Athena to help him. She appears and argues with the furies, before holding a court of law, with a jury of twelve Athenian citizens.</p>

<p>Apollo argues with the furies, and they argue back. Apollo argues that <i>“The woman you call the mother of the child is not the parent, just a nurse to the seed … The man is the source of life – the one who mounts.” </i>(Aeschylus, pg 260) Athena steps in and argues for Orestes, saying <i>“Orestes, I will cast my lot for you... Even if the vote is equal, Orestes wins."</i>(Aeschylus, pg 264) The ballot is tied, so Orestes does win. The furies are furious, but Athena consoles them, making them citizens of Athens and guardians of the city.</p>
