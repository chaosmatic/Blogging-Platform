<h2>Code</h2>
Any code that I write will be posted here. Some of it will be course work for my Software development course, other parts will be made for my enjoyment.<p>
<a href="http://github.com/chaosmatic/Phone-directory">Phone Directory</a> - This phone directory is web based, using PHP and MySQL.<p> 
<a href="http://github.com/chaosmatic/Blogging-Platform">Blogging platform</a> - Again in PHP and MySQL, I am currently satisfied with it. It is what I am currently using for this website.<p>

<a href="Chudnovsky.zip">Chudnovsky Algorithm</a> - This is my attempt at the Chudnovsky Algorithm in python. It can be accurate to 30,000 decimal places however is quite inefficient. <p>
